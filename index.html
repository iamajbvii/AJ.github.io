    <h3>What I did this week</h3>
    <p>
      I developed a code that will start clipping video when it detects that hands are moving, and will stop clipping when the hands stop moving and are at rest. I tested the code with one of my final project presentations, and it seems to work. It did successfully clip video when I started talking, and stopped clipping when I stopped talking. Although the code is not perfect, as it clips when I do gestures or gesticulations. This led me to think of my research question.
      I created a draft PowerPoint for presentation next Friday and started a draft on the Lit Review Paper.
    </p>

    <h3>Research Question</h3>
    <p>
      How can AI determine the difference between when a person is talking with sign language and when a person is talking using gesture and/or gesticulation?<br>
      Is it possible to develop a model that can naturally detect sign language and normal gestures and tell the difference between them?<br>
      What are the qualifications or requirements to determine if the video is qualified to be used in training data to train the model to detect the difference between sign language and gesture/gesticulation?
    </p>

    <h3>Action Plan</h3>
    <p>
      Need to find which videos are copyrighted and which aren’t.<br>
      Contact them to obtain permission.<br>
      I did develop a draft email, but I haven’t sent the email.<br>
      Get access to the NAS so I can start testing video in my code.

    <h2>Week 1 Report</h2>
    <p>
      My first week at REU AICT research was mainly focused on finding research papers for the literature review. 
      My team includes Abdullah Alghamdi and me. We focus on finding ASL data and determining how the research 
      papers touch topics such as methods to track signs and body, the amount of time the face and hands are 
      detected (signing and not signing), criteria for estimating the body pose, use open or closed captioning, 
      and the percentage of success. I have developed two different methods for note-taking. One method involves 
      a detailed explanation of whether the research papers talk about each topic. Other methods include simplified 
      checklists and brief notes. This method is known as Too Long; Didn’t Read (TL;DR). I found 8 research papers 
      that I can use. I went through their topics and created notes on whether they satisfy the checklist or not, 
      and put them all in two documents.
